WANT TO PUBLISH OPEN ACCESS IN
Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition?

Dear Dr Langkvist,

Access to quality research is vital to the scientific community and beyond. We support sustainable access and work hard to provide a range of open access (OA) options alongside our access initiatives to ensure everyone can read, use and trust the latest research.

We are committed to working in partnership with the computer science research community, librarians, funders and other stakeholders to provide a range of OA Options.

Publishing your research as an OA article with Elsevier will mean that it:

    Is peer-reviewed
    Is immediately free to access online upon publication
    Can be shared and used by readers as defined by your user license
    Has an OA fee paid by you, or on your behalf (e.g. your institution or funding body)
